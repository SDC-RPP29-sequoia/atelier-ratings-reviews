# https://www.howtoforge.com/how-to-increase-the-disk-space-of-an-aws-ec2-ubuntu-instance/

# Go to the EC2 instance -- > Volume attached to the instance.
# Here you see the volume, click on "Actions" --> "Modify Volumes".
# On the pop-up screen, specify the desired size. I have specified 30 GBs, earlier it was 8 GBs. Click on the "Modify" button, this will change the disk size to 30GBs.
# Confirm the modification by clicking on the "Yes" option.

# Extend the Filesystem.
# At this point, if you check the disk space you will see that the / volume still has 7.7 GBs.

df -h

#To extend the volume size, get information about the block devices attached to your instance using the lsblk command

lsblk

#Check the file system type, use the following command.

blkid

sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1

lsblk
df -h

#In our case, the file system is of type ext4 of the volume
#Use the following command to extend the volume of the ext4 type.

sudo resize2fs /dev/xvda1

#If you check the disk size this time, you will see that the disk has been extended and now we have 28 GBs(Approx 30 GBs) for / partition.

df -h

#If you see some other file system than ext4, visit the official documentation of AWS here.
