PREREQUISITES

This assumes that you have already experimented with creating instances under EC2 and know
how to use ssh keys to access an instance.  If not, try experimenting with that first and
setup some keys.

This also assume that you have a Security Group with Port 80 available.  If not, experiment
with creating one of those as well.

3. You should be on the EC2 Dashboard page - if not, click EC2 Dashboard under Navigation
4. Click: Launch Instance
5. Select: Quick Launch
6. Select: Ubuntu Server 11.10 / 64 bit
7. Click: Continue
8. Click: Edit Details
9. Expand: Security Settings

11. Click: Save Details
12: Click: Launch
13: Click: Close
14. You should be back in the dashboard
15. Click: Instance
16. While waiting for your instance to boot up, the Name should default to "Empty"
 - click on it and give it a new name, like "nodejs1"

LOGIN TO INSTANCE

1. Click on the instance so that you can see it's host name.
